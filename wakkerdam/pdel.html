		  <h1>Probabilistic Dynamic Epistemic Logic</h1>
		  <p>Our initial approach was to use a Probabilistic Dynamic Epistemic Logic (PDEL) as proposed in [1]. Given the limited amount of time and the lack of knowledge about <a href="del.html">dynamic epistemic logic</a>, it turned out to be an overambituous project. Nevertheless we (try to) explain PDEL and it's possible benefits to model the werewolves game. We hope that future projects might benefit from this information. </p>
		  <p>
		  In epistemic logic we have a relation between world $s_1$ to $s_2$ for agent $i$ when the agent could not distinguish between the two worlds. We are, however, not able to model how likely an agent $i$ consider it possible that $s_1$ is an epistemic alternative. In probabilistic epistemic logic an extension is made by including a probabilistic relation in the kripke model beside the usual accessibility relation. Due to this new probabilistic relation we are able to express that an agent assigns a certain probability to a logical sentence(including higher-order statements). For example in the werewolves game it would be realistic to include that agent $2$ believes with probability $a$ that player $1$ is a werewolf. An initial kripke model for PDEL is also straight forward to implement since it resembles the initial model for <a href="del.html">dynamic epistemic logic</a>: in every world for each agent we have that each world should be assigned probability $\frac{1}{4}$.  
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 More interesting are the update models for PDEL. In [1] they use three types of probabilities: prior, occurrence and observation. The prior probabilities are specified in the initial model e.g. the model described in the end of the previous paragraph. The occurrence probabilities specify the agent view on which event produces with probability a certain type of information(precondition). In DEL events are one to one related to preconditions. Here we consider that a certain event can produce different types of preconditions. In events we have modelled in the werewolve game, we do not really need this occurrence probabilities. For example when a player views a Werewolf card, he always recieve the information that he his a werewolf. This means that occurrence probability are 0 or 1 in this case. Thirdly, we have occurrence probabilities. This allows to express that we are
